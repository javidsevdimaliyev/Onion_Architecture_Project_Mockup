# Onion_Architecture_Project_Mockup

## Overview
This project is an example of a clean and scalable architecture using several advanced techniques and patterns. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to implement Onion Architecture with Entity Framework Core, the Generic Repository Design Pattern, Unit of Work, Dapper Repository, CQRS Mediator Design Pattern, and ASP.NET Core Identity for User Role and Claim management.

## Technologies and Patterns Used
- **Onion Architecture**: To enforce a clean separation of concerns and dependencies across different layers of the application.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: For data access and management using the Generic Repository and Unit of Work patterns.
- **Dapper**: For high-performance data access where EF Core is not necessary.
- **Generic Repository Design Pattern**: To provide a flexible and reusable data access layer.
- **Unit of Work**: To manage transactions across multiple repositories.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: To separate read and write operations for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Mediator Pattern**: For handling CQRS requests and responses.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: For managing user authentication, authorization, roles, and claims.

## Project Structure
The project is organized according to the principles of Onion Architecture, ensuring that core business logic is independent of external dependencies.

### Layers:
1. **Core**: Contains the domain entities, value objects, and interfaces.
2. **Application**: Contains the CQRS commands, queries, and handlers, as well as the service interfaces.
3. **Infrastructure**: Contains the EF Core DbContext, repositories, and other data access implementations including Dapper.
4. **API**: The presentation layer, which exposes the functionality through RESTful endpoints.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   cd project
